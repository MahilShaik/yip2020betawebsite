<!-- This is the homepage of the website.
Try to write all the code as neat and descriptive as possible with proper indentations as others will also have to work on the same code, so the code must be human-readable and not just machine readable.
Don't try to edit/change any other file in the repo, except the once alloted to you. Otherwise you get errors using GITHUB -->
